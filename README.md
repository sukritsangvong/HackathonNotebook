# HackathonNotebook(MUDAC)

This repository only contains the part that I was responsible for in the competition.

#### Background:
  
  Prior to the competition, I had close to 0 knowledge on College-level Stats and had written about 100 lines of R. 
  Getting into the competition really challenged me in an extreme way. It took me a couple hours to do task that should 
  have been done by 15 minutes. The good thing was that the questions were separated into 4 different parts which allow 
  me to struggle on my part without holding the team back as much. Although it was a painful 48 hours, I had fun. 
  With more knowledge and experience, this type of competition will be very enjoyable.

Questions I was responsible for:

-  Identify districts that have a high (or low) filing rate
-  Identify demographic features of a district that could be used to distinguish districts with a high filing rate 
from districts with a low filing rate?

#### Exlpaination on the outputs

ratio_frequency: shows the number of fillings on all districts(43 to 69) and the number of fillings in Ratio over 100,000

demographic_model: shows the demographics and the identification of high(1) and low(0) with the frequency of the filling in color

#### Reflection

There are A LOT that can be improved on my part. The primary things that I got from this competition are the basis of R, the understanding of federal civil cases data, the pain of data collection(on demographic), and what it takes to come up with a conclusion under the lens of a statistician.
